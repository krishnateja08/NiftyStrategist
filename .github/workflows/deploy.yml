#  Krishna Markets — Intelligence Hub
#  GitHub Actions: Deploy static index.html to GitHub Pages
#
#  HOW IT WORKS:
#    This workflow simply copies the index.html (the Glass
#    Aurora hub) to GitHub Pages. No Python, no build step.
#    It's a pure static HTML file — no re-execution needed.
#    The page auto-refreshes content dynamically via iframes.
#
#  TRIGGERS:
#    • On every push to main branch (auto-deploy)
#    • Manually via Actions → Run workflow button
